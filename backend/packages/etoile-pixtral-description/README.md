# etoile_pixtral_description

`etoile_pixtral_description` is a Python package designed to extract detailed descriptions from images using advanced language models. It focuses on providing concrete descriptions of visible content characteristics on web pages or other digital media, making it particularly useful for content analysis, accessibility improvements, and SEO enhancements.

## Installation

To install `etoile_pixtral_description`, use pip:

```bash
pip install etoile_pixtral_description
```

## Usage

The package provides a function `describe_image` that generates a detailed description of the content found within an image. It uses the `ScreenContentSimplified` model for structured output.

### Setting Up the Model

from langchain_mistralai import ChatMistralAI

CVISION_MODEL = "pixtral-12b-2409"

llm = ChatMistralAI(
    model=CVISION_MODEL,
    temperature=0,
    max_retries=2,
)
```

### Describing an Image

```python
from etoile_pixtral_description import describe_image

# `screenshot.link` should be a string containing the URL to the image you want to describe.
screenshot_link = "https://example.com/path/to/screenshot.jpg"
result = describe_image(llm, screenshot_link, verbose=True)
print(result)
# Assuming `result` contains a property `description` which holds the detailed description.
```

This function returns a structured response with a detailed description of each content characteristic on the screen, which is useful for various applications, including digital asset management and accessibility compliance.
